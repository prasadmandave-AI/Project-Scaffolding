Classification Rules & Keywords:
- Assign the boolean value true if the condition is explicitly mentioned or is strongly implied by definitive radiographic signs (e.g., severe pattern, abnormal size, clear effusion).
- Assign **false** if the condition is not mentioned, is ruled out, or is described as normal.
- Use the specific keywords provided in the condition definitions below to guide your classification.

Conditions to Classify (21 Keys):
{
    "perihilar_infiltrate": "True if there is evidence of perihilar pattern, infiltrate, or increased opacity around the heart base.",
    "pneumonia": "True if there is evidence of consolidation, alveolar pattern, or a definitive diagnosis of pneumonia/bronchopneumonia.",
    "bronchitis": "True if there is evidence of a bronchial pattern (e.g., 'tram lines,' 'donuts'), bronchial thickening, or a diagnosis of bronchitis.",
    "interstitial": "True if there is evidence of an interstitial pattern (structured or unstructured), which includes diffuse haze or increased lung density.",
    "diseased_lungs": "True if the report suggests any general, significant, or diffuse lung abnormality or widespread pulmonary disease (e.g., 'severe pulmonary pattern,' 'diffuse lung pathology').",
    "hypo_plastic_trachea": "True if the trachea is explicitly described as hypoplastic or abnormally narrow/small.",
    "cardiomegaly": "True if the report indicates any general heart enlargement, increased cardiac silhouette, or an increased vertebral heart score (VHS > 10.5).",
    "pulmonary_nodules": "True if the report mentions pulmonary nodule(s), masses, or any focal rounded opacities (metastases).",
    "pleural_effusion": "True if the report mentions pleural effusion, pleural fluid, or a widened pleural fissure line (fluid in the chest cavity, NOT pericardium).",
    "rtm": "True if the report mentions redundancy of the trachealis membrane (RTM) or dorsal tracheal membrane thickening/redundancy.",
    "focal_caudodorsal_lung": "True if there is localized (focal) abnormality (e.g., consolidation, mass, lesion) in the caudal-dorsal lung field.",
    "focal_perihilar": "True if a localized abnormality (mass, infiltrate) is identified specifically in the perihilar region.",
    "pulmonary_hypoinflation": "True if the report indicates decreased lung volume, hypoinflation, microcardia, or a significantly elevated diaphragm.",
    "right_sided_cardiomegaly": "True if the report mentions specific enlargement of the right atrium (RA) or right ventricle (RV).",
    "pericardial_effusion": "True if the report mentions fluid specifically within the pericardial sac, globoid cardiac silhouette, or cardiac tamponade.",
    "bronchiectasis": "True if the report mentions bronchiectasis, dilated bronchi, or bronchial dilation.",
    "pulmonary_vessel_enlargement": "True if the report describes enlarged, dilated, or prominent pulmonary arteries and/or veins (pulmonary vascular congestion).",
    "left_sided_cardiomegaly": "True if the report mentions specific enlargement of the left atrium (LA) or left ventricle (LV).",
    "thoracic_lymphadenopathy": "True if the report mentions enlarged thoracic, sternal, or tracheobronchial lymph nodes.",
    "esophagitis": "True if the report mentions evidence of esophagitis, megaesophagus, or tracheal deviation due to an enlarged esophagus.",
    "vhs_v2": "True if the report provides a calculated Vertebral Heart Score (VHS) that is above the normal range (typically > 10.5 or a specific abnormality based on VHS)."
}

Strict Output Constraint:
- Your response must be "ONLY a single, valid JSON object" containing the keys listed above and their corresponding boolean values (`true` or `false`, lowercase).
- Do not include ANY other text, markdown formatting (e.g., ```json), or explanation.
